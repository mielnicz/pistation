This is simple frame and supporting electronics to turn a Raspberry Pi into
a nice little worksation. My goal was to make a small, self contained module
containing the Raspberry Pi itself, some simple input and a display.

I originally designed this simply so I could have a single module with audio
and video that I could carry around easily. All I need to do is plug in a
power cable and a network cable and it's ready to go (if you use a WiFi dongle
you don't even need the network cable).

There are a variety of other uses. Some things that came to mind as I was
building it:

* An always on Minecraft system. [Minecraft Pi](http://pi.minecraft.net/) can
act as a server for Minecraft Pocket. Set up a globally accessable server and
write a script using the API to focus on whatever user is most active at the
moment. Use the buttons to focus on a particular user. Put it in your lounge
room, leave it running and enjoy the show.
* Control interface for networked devices. Use it for home automation or
security as a master control unit. Monitor your servers, website, whatever.
Once again - put it in your lounge and enjoy the show.
* Follow Twitter, Facebook or any other regularly updating feed. Even at the
low resolution of the screen you should be able to see a couple of updates
at a time.

The possibilities are endless, go wild with it.

I've used an open frame so you can still access all the connectors on the Pi
so you can easily add additional hardware to the device. The majority of the
frame has been 3D printed and the OpenSCAD files are provided in the repository
so you can modify it to be a closed frame if you like.

This is still very much a work in progress. Feel free to jump in and contribute
with your own ideas and bug fixes.
