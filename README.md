This is simple frame and supporting electronics to make a nice little frame
for a Raspberry Pi. My goal was to make a small, self contained module containing
the Raspberry Pi itself, some simple input and a display.

I've used an open frame so you can still access all the connectors on the Pi.
Most of the frame has been 3D printed and the OpenSCAD files are provided in
the repository so you can modify it to be a closed frame if you like.
